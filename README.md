## Project 1) AI-Driven Medical Claims Fraud Detection System
  **Explanation:**
	>	Isolation Forest is used for anomaly detection (fraud detection).
		Data scaling is applied to claims data, and the model is evaluated on its     
    ability to detect fraudulent claims.


## Project 2) AI-Powered Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for Sepsis Prediction
  **Explanation:**
	>	Preprocessing of EHR data: cleaning and normalization.
		Model uses an LSTM for time-series data (patient vitals).
		Binary classification for sepsis detection.


## Project 3)  Automated AI Model for Cancer Risk Stratification
  **Explanation:**
	>	Multi-modal data: Images and genomic data are combined in a deep learning model.
		ResNet50 is used for image feature extraction.
		Genomic data is processed separately and fused with the image data.
